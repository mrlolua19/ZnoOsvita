# ZnoOsvita
My little project for zno.osvita.ua to simulate that you get high grades.


Tutorial:
1. Open main.py and replace url and executable path with yourss.
2. Open the cmd in the current folder with requirements.txt and run  "pip install -r requirements.txt"
3. Now just run the script and enjoy!

On zno osvita it changes only VISUALLY, it doesn't actually solve all the questions
